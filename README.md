# GenArt

A repository where I explore generative art ideas.

## Autumn Projects

In the [Autumn 2021](Aut2021/README.md) I started experimenting with creative
coding ideas. Some of the projects I created are in the
Aut2021 folder. 

Two works from these projects are illustrated in the end of this README.

## Blog

The blog folder contains work from some blog posts I am currently working on or I have worked on in the past. 

## Books

This folder contains JS scripts for many of the examples presented in this excellent [book](https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Art-Practical-Guide-Processing/dp/1935182625/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3BT2I6CP5PBAK&keywords=processing+art&qid=1662129404&s=books&sprefix=processing+ar%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C240&sr=1-3) 
(Generative Art: A practical Guide Using Processing: Matt Pearson).

## FunProjects

The fun project contains some random personal projects I worked on. 
In the Aquarelle project I am trying to replicate the texture of watercolor paper.
In geometry limit I have created an artwork 
based on the polygonal approximation of the cycle.
