# GenArt

A repository where I explore generative art ideas.

## Autumn Project

In the Autumn project I will be creating a piece every week of autumn starting at 06/09/2021. This project has mostly learning purposes. 

### First Piece Week 1 - 06/09/2021 - 12/09/2021

Two frames of the generative piece of week 1 with different
parameters follow.
